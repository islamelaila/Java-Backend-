1. Convert the Employee class into an abstract class.
   - Make the method `work() abstract inside it.
   - Remove any implementation of work() from Employee.

2. Create an interface called Eatable.
   - It should have one method: void eat();

3. Have both Chef and Waiter implement the interface Eatable.
   - In Chef, make eat() print: "Chef [name] is tasting the food."
   - In Waiter, make eat() print: "Waiter [name] is having a quick meal break."
